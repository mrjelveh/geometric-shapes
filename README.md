# Geometric Shapes


## How to Run

This project uses npm for package management. Here are some commands you can use:

- `npm install`: Install the project dependencies.
- `npm dev` : Run the project
- `npm run storybook`: Start the Storybook.

## Technologies Used

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Vite is a build tool and development server that provides fast and efficient bundling for JavaScript and TypeScript projects.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): A tool for developing UI components in isolation.

## If I had more time, I would do the following

- A better styling structure (using a theme and pallete throughout the project).
- Utilizing loose coupling structure for canvas component to make it more modular
- Adding test(unit/e2e) to the project
- using [D3-Zoom](https://d3js.org/d3-zoom) to pan, zoom-in and zoom-out in the canvas
